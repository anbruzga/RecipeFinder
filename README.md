# RecipeFinder
 Recipe finder, which used Food2Fork Api, which says it is now closed. Allows to store products, that can be saved, reused, searched, modified, deleted. In the past, when I have created it, it allowed to query the API and displayed the results which had the selected ingredients.
 
 All the data are stored persistently, therefore can be reused later.
